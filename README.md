🔰 **Level**: Advanced
🛠️ **Tools Used**- Microsoft Excel, Screener.in, EquityMaster, Investing.com, Annual Reports, YouTube (for self-learning)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project simulates a complete financial modeling and valuation exercise for Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. (NSE: MARUTI | BSE: 532500). 
It demonstrates the ability to build a financial model from scratch, including 3-statement linking, forecasting, ratio analysis, and DCF valuation, in Excel — without relying on templates. 
The model aims to assess Maruti’s financial health, project future performance, and determine its intrinsic value. Skills showcased include dynamic Excel modeling, financial statement structuring, scenario analysis, and valuation modeling.

## 🎯 Objectives

1. Build a Clean, Modular Financial Model in Excel following market conventions.
2. Link the 3 Core Statements: Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement.
3. Apply Excel Techniques like Data Validation, VLOOKUP, Goal Seek, Data Tables, and Scenario Manager.
4. Forecast Key Metrics: Sales, EBITDA, EPS, and margins.
5. Perform Valuation Analysis: DCF, Sensitivity Analysis, and Comparable Company Multiples.
6. Evaluate Risk using Altman's Z Score and Monte Carlo Simulation for VaR.
7. Ensure Model Protection using Excel locking and sheet protection.
